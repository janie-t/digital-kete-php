        <p>I live in Lower Hutt with my two tamariki, my partner, dog and chickens. I was a secondary school teacher for 15 years and loved teaching digital technology. I left that in 2016 to study with Enspiral Dev Academy. I am currently looking for work as a web developer. I like vintage stuff (such as cute teacups!). I also try my hand at photography - have a look at my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dogsofpetone/" target="_blank">Dogs of Petone Beach facebook page</a> (if you like dogs too).</p>
        <p>I believe in social equity, and working towards making our communities better for everyone. The health of my Whanau (family), Whenua (land/environment) and Wairua (spriritual) is at the heart of everything I do.
